        <p>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun (764)
            BY EMILY DICKINSON
            My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -
            In Corners - till a Day
            The Owner passed - identified -
            And carried Me away -
            
            And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
            And now We hunt the Doe -
            And every time I speak for Him
            The Mountains straight reply -
            
            And do I smile, such cordial light
            Opon the Valley glow -
            It is as a Vesuvian face
            Had let it’s pleasure through -
            
            And when at Night - Our good Day done -
            I guard My Master’s Head -
            ’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
            Deep Pillow - to have shared -
            
            To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
            None stir the second time -
            On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
            Or an emphatic Thumb -
            
            Though I than He - may longer live
            He longer must - than I -
            For I have but the power to kill,
            Without - the power to die -</p>
